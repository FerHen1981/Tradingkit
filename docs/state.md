## Datasets

Tracked in `data/manifest.json` (not yet created). No analysis may cite a dataset
that is not registered there.

| Symbol | Range | CVD valid from | Rows | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NQ | 2023-06-18 → 2026-06-17 | **unknown** | ~1.1M | TradingView 1m export | in use, CVD depth unverified |

## In-sample / out-of-sample

Defined on the **CVD-valid window**, not the calendar.

- **In-sample**: everything up to ~2024.
- **Walk-forward**: `funnel.py` restarts a fresh eval at many points — this is
  the working OOS for the eval question.
- **Sealed holdout**: most recent 12 months. Untouched until a config is frozen.
  One look, one verdict.
- **Note**: the 2023-2026 window is already *burnt* — the roll/OpEx factory was
  tuned on it (`CLAUDE.md`: "validated, 3y OOS"). It is in-sample by use.

## Units — how pips and ticks are made comparable

Three different jobs, three different normalisations. Mixing them is how a
"9-tick gap" gets copied from NQ to GC and quietly means something else.

| Layer | Unit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Signal geometry (gap size, stop, TP, trail) | **ATR multiples** (`--unit-mode ATR`) | Ticks are instrument-native and do not port. ATR self-scales to each instrument's volatility. |
| Trade outcome | **R** (risk multiples) | Every trade risks 1R by construction, so R compares across instruments and strategies. |
| Account / goal outcome | **DD-units** = % of that account's trailing-drawdown allowance | This is the prop-firm-native unit. Both goals are *defined* in it: an eval is "+target before -1.0 DD", funded survival is "never touch -1.0 DD". |

DD-units are the primary reporting unit. They make GC on a 50k Apex directly
comparable to 6E on a 100k FTMO, which dollars and percentages of balance do not.

## Open decisions (blocking)

1. **How far back does real per-bar `Delta` actually go?** Source is **Quantower**,
   so depth is set by the *connection* behind it, not by Quantower. Run
   `tools/validate_dataset.py` on a single pilot export — it prints the CVD
   boundary. That boundary is the research window. See `docs/data_export.md`.
   → *Needed from Ferry: which data connection/vendor.*
2. **Data hosting.** ~500 MB CSV per symbol per 15y: too large for git (100 MB/file
   hard limit) and for the LFS free tier. Proposed: Parquet+zstd (4-10× smaller,
   `validate_dataset.py --to-parquet`) published as **GitHub Release assets**,
   fetched per analysis. Requires a Parquet branch in `backtest/data.py` (not yet
   built).
3. **Continuous-contract stitching** — back-adjusted or raw-spliced? This strategy
   reads 3-bar fair-value gaps, and a raw roll gap can manufacture a signal that
   never traded. Roll dates, if exportable, let us mask instead of guess.
4. **BTC**: CME futures start Dec 2017 (max ~8.5y). Contract spec in `config.py:42`
   marked **verify** (BTC=5 vs MBT micro).
5. **FX futures multipliers** (`6E/6B/6J/6A/6S/6C`) marked **verify** in
   `config.py:44-49`. Both 4 and 5 resolve from Quantower's Symbol Info panel:
   tick size, tick value, multiplier, full-size vs micro.

## Settled

- **Micros**: not exported. Same price series as full-size; only the multiplier
  differs and it already lives in `config.py` `CONTRACTS`. CVD is read from the
  liquid full-size contract even when trading micros.
- **QQQ and other non-tradables**: not strategy datasets, but they *do* go through
  the mill as **context series** for correlation work (see below).
- **1-minute is the storage base.** `data.py:resample()` is session-aligned and
  sums `Delta`/`BuyVolume`/`SellVolume`; volume delta is additive, so every higher
  timeframe is derivable. Only intrabar ordering is lost — a short tick or 1s
  window would let us price the engine's pessimistic stop-first assumption.

## The fleet problem — why accounts liquidate together

Four accounts hitting liquidation at once is not four bad accounts, it is **one
position held four times**. `middleware/app/risk.py` gates per account
(`_halted` is a per-account, per-day set); nothing sees the portfolio. And the
funded edges are NQ/ES/GC — NQ and ES correlate around 0.9, so fanning one
strategy across them is leverage wearing the costume of diversification.

This makes correlation analysis (incl. the non-tradable context series) a
first-class part of Goal B, not a curiosity, and it means the Goal-B tooling must
model the **fleet**: N accounts, correlated returns, per-firm rules → distribution
of accounts alive at T, accounts reaching 6/6, and P(≥k simultaneous breaches).
`funnel.py` today models one account at a time.

## Not started

- `data-contract` skill (dataset registration + CVD gate)
- `eval-throughput` skill (Goal A metrics)
- `payout-throughput` skill (Goal B metrics)
- `recap` skill (fixed weekly format)
- El Presidente dashboards (two URLs, one per goal)
